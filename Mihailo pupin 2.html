        <p> Mihajlo Idvorski Pupin, Ph.D., LL.D. <strong>(Serbian Cyrillic: Михајло Идворски Пупин; 9 October 1858 – 12 March 1935)</strong> also known as Michael I. Pupin, was a Serbian American physicist and physical chemist. 
            Pupin is best known for his numerous patents, including a means of greatly extending the range of long-distance telephone communication by placing loading coils (of wire) at predetermined intervals along the transmitting wire (known as "pupinization"). 
            Pupin was a founding member of National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) on March 3, 1915, which later became NASA.</p>
